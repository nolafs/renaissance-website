    - name: Candice Shane
      position: NA Content Creator Specialist
      text: >-
        After a chance friendship with the Editor-In-Chief of a well-respected
        gaming magazine was struck, Candice was encouraged to take a step into
        writing reviews and editorials. During her mentorship, she noticed an
        intense lack of women given entrance into the 'Boys Club' of most gaming
        publications and sought to push through those doors, from website to
        website. In the mid-to-late-00s, as the digital imprint of gaming
        expanded, Candice moved into being a Consulting Editor. This allowed her
        the ability to come onto the staff of multiple websites and infuse a
        woman's perspective where it was sorely needed. 


        In 2013, Candice was approached to head up the written content for Loot Crate, aptly called "The Daily Crate" which was a review/impressions site for all things gaming and pop culture. This expanded into assisting with building up attention to their Twitch channel until it was turned into a rotating chair live-show.


        TL;DR - Writer, Content Creator & Podcaster with a SEVERE passion for gaming joined Renaissance in 2020.

    - name: Bella Shane
      position: NA Content Creator Specialist
      text: >-
        Bella joined Renaissance PR in 2023 to find a way to marry her love of
        research and data with gaming and influencer culture. Renaissance was
        the perfect place to learn strategy for content creators and utilize her
        love for the fast paced world of gaming and the factual world of
        research that she loves so much. 


        Before joining, Bella helped people research all manner of details and enjoyed quite a bit of time fact-checking for editors, analysts and ghostwriters. Not wanting to hand over her research towards clients that she felt weren't giving the best service with her data, she looked towards becoming more hands on in an industry she already widely respected and had loved from a young age.

        After turning to journalism full-time through the pandemic, he picked up bylines across sites like NME and Gfinity.
