        After a chance friendship with the Editor-In-Chief of a well-respected
        gaming magazine was struck, Candice was encouraged to take a step into
        writing reviews and editorials. During her mentorship, she noticed an
        intense lack of women given entrance into the 'Boys Club' of most gaming
        publications and sought to push through those doors, from website to
        website. In the mid-to-late-00s, as the digital imprint of gaming
        expanded, Candice moved into being a Consulting Editor. This allowed her
        the ability to come onto the staff of multiple websites and infuse a
        woman's perspective where it was sorely needed. 


        In 2013, Candice was approached to head up the written content for Loot Crate, aptly called "The Daily Crate" which was a review/impressions site for all things gaming and pop culture. This expanded into assisting with building up attention to their Twitch channel until it was turned into a rotating chair live-show.
