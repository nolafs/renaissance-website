# Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement
**Renaissance PR**

This statement is published in line with the principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and outlines the steps Renaissance PR takes to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking within its business and supply chains.

---

## Our Business

Renaissance PR is an independent public relations consultancy operating as a fully remote organisation. We provide professional communications services and work with a combination of employees and external consultants. Our activities are service-based and are not carried out in sectors typically associated with a high risk of modern slavery.

The majority of our work is undertaken within the United Kingdom, with limited use of overseas consultants where appropriate.

---

## Our Commitment

Renaissance PR has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, forced labour, and human trafficking. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to taking proportionate steps to ensure such practices do not occur within our operations or supply chains.

We do not knowingly engage with any organisation that supports or is involved in slavery or human trafficking.

---

## Supply Chains and Risk

Our supply chain is limited and primarily consists of:

- External consultants and freelancers
- Software and technology service providers
- Event and professional service partners

Given the nature of our business and supply chain, we consider our exposure to the risk of modern slavery to be low. We do not have any agreements with trade unions.

---

## Due Diligence and Steps Taken

To help prevent modern slavery, we:

- Work with reputable suppliers and consultants
- Maintain clear onboarding and contractual arrangements
- Review supplier relationships where appropriate
- Encourage transparency and the reporting of concerns

To our knowledge, we have not been involved in any business relationship where modern slavery has been identified.

---

## Policies and Awareness

Our commitment to ethical working practices is supported by internal policies and procedures, including our company handbook, code of conduct, and whistleblowing arrangements. These set expectations around fair treatment, professional behaviour, and lawful working practices.

---

## Reporting Concerns

Renaissance PR does not have a designated Slavery Compliance Officer. Any concerns relating to modern slavery or human trafficking should be reported directly to the Director, **Stefano Petrullo**, who will take appropriate action.

This statement has been approved by the Director of Renaissance PR and will be reviewed periodically.
