In addition, Renaissance supported Grasshopper & NetEase Japan by securing space in the B2B area at the show, whilst also producing physical key art, various design props for photo opportunities to document the meetings with Suda-san, alongside special T-shirts for the development team & media/creator guests, all in collaboration with our sister company, Studio Co2.

Our Gamescom activation resulted in **27 media appointments,** delivering **73 pieces of content** resulting in a **UVPM of 852,152,855** with articles delivered from key Tier 1 outlets including **PCGamesN, Gaming Bible, WCCFTech, Gamespot, Game Informer, Multiplayer, Digital Foundry, The Gamer** & more. From the show, we have also secured several future exclusive opportunities for coverage. Conversely, we were also told that the UVPM earned also surpassed that of their Sony State of Play reveal earlier this year.
