This Partnership secured a number of front-page slots on Twitch’s homepage in key territories with views for these slots resulting in the hundreds of thousands for creators & subsequently Dark Envoy.​

​The paid campaign covered off the key regions of the game, with relevant & curated talent across **Twitch, YouTube & TikTok**, all of whom made sense for the game & had the right audience. Talent were secured at rates well below management asks, due to the targeted outreach, personal relations & pitch for the game. ​

The Dark Envoy paid campaign produced just shy of **700,000 overall views**, largely at launch, which helped support a strong overall campaign including organic outreach & coverage totaling just over **3,000,000 views**.
