Demonstrating at Epic’s Unreal stand at GDC, Renaissance was set the task of using Luna Abyss’s appearance in San Francisco to give both global media their first hands on with the game & to utilise the media opportunities locally to create industry buzz.

As a result, we headed out to the US the week before GDC to give select media based in the region exclusive early access to the build to help build momentum through the event as a whole.

In terms of both appointments & the resulting coverage, GDC 2023 was one of the most successful events in Renaissance’s history, with more than **120 articles reaching an estimated monthly audience of over 620 million people worldwide**, as well as multiple pieces across IGN’s global network & a livestreamed interview on Kinda Funny. Other outlets who jumped aboard the hype train included **Game Rant, VG247, Gazetta dello Sport & RockPaperShotgun**.

**“Move over Returnal”** proclaimed RockPaperShotgun’s Editor-in-chief Katharine Castle. **“Luna Abyss is your next favourite bullet hell shooter.”**
