At the request of one of our international agency partners, Renaissance were tasked with creating a series of out of home executions to tie in with the marketing campaign for the launch of Diablo 4 – these ideas ranged from 3D billboards, Public Transport take-overs and the erection of life-sized monuments to the games central character, Lilith – Daughter of Mephisto.

It was this final idea that was selected by Activision Blizzard for deployment in partnership with German retail partner, Saturn, to mark the launch of the game.

Working with the client and award winning production agency, Wild Creations, Renaissance took the concept from initial brain-storm through multiple rounds of amendments, all the way through to the creation of a "Children of Lilith" retail activation at the Europa Center in Berlin – complete with flowing "blood“.
