​

Approx. **100 Tier 1 media** were pitched hands on code access on a **1-to-1 basis via email**, as well as targeted via Press Engine with the production chain and launch trailer press releases (11th and 18th January respectively) both of which performed well with **open rates around 40%**.  We also assigned 105 codes via press engine.​

​The biggest wins were previews with **Screen Rant (96m), PCGamesN (13m), Gamestar (11.2m) and Eurogamer.de (4.8m)**.​

Renaissance also supported with content creators, reaching out to an existing list of content creator targets, covering a global campaign excluding (GSA, Russia and Asia). This was around 70 creators. ​ Alongside this we also also did new research of our own, took over the Lurkit page & managed inbound requests which put us in contact with **over 350 targets**.​
