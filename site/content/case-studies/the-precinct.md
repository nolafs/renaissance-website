Renaissance was also responsible for the NA & EU content creator & influencer campaign, researching & outreaching to over **200 targeted creators**, focusing on Tier 1 with a provable history of playing games of this type/genre.



7 days post launch The Precinct content had been viewed over **9.1 million times**, although this number is likely considerably higher based on the sheer number of smaller creators not within this & the overall subscriber base for content was just under **164 million**.

This is just the beginning as the popularity has led to many more codes being distributed & we expect these numbers to grow significantly within the first month of launch & beyond!
