The initial focus centred on securing interviews & feature stories following the game’s preview at SGF. Coverage was secured from outlets including **GameSpot(50m), Screen Rant(84m), Game Rant(46m), IGN Brazil(20m), Terra(70m)** & many more, laying the groundwork for what became a full-force review program.

An aggressive pre-launch guide coordination strategy was deployed, resulting in over **450 guides** published from notable media outlets including **IGN, Polygon, Kotaku, Game8, TheGamer & Game Rant**, to name just a few. Total reviews published in the Americas exceeded **120**.  All of this has been achieved organically via clear curation targeting the right media who would be best suited to cover the game.
