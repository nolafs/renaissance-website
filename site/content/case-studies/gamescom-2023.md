Renaissance was the Global agency for Gamescom 2023. Reach for the event campaign totaled **299 pieces of coverage & 3.7 billion UVPM**, this was covering both Gamescom & ONL.

The agency also managed the pre-event list for press at ONL & then had staff on site to grant press access to the show as well as a dedicated interview/digital conference with Geoff Keighley.

The team achieved coverage on T**ech Radar, The Guardian, VGC, USA Today, YYSTV, The Radio Times, NME, MCV & IGN Brazil** to name a few thanks to the strong relationship with influencing global media & carefully planning of the content, making Renaissance the first UK agency ever recruited to support the event on a global scale.
