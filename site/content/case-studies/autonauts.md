  Renaissance, in partnership with Curve Digital, were the lead PR agency in
  bringing the captivating and unique colonisation and coding game, Autonauts,
  to market. Starting with announcement in July 2019 to launch in October. This
  short campaign had a laser focus, targeting specialist and mainstream media
  that would give this unique premise a chance with cover features in Wireframe
  Magazine (UK), lead review in The Guardian newspaper's weekly G2 supplement
  (including online), as well as regular coverage on Eurogamer (UK), Polygon
  (NA), Rock Paper Shotgun (UK) and other opinion-leading outlets. Over 300
  articles worldwide from notable media were achieved worldwide during the
  campaign including 50+ reviews culminating in a Metacritic score of 80.


  We also spearheaded Autonauts appearance at Yogcon, gamescom, Develop, EGX,
  and Twitchcon - including designing keynotes to be presented by key talent
  behind the development of the game.


  Wooing content creators to help spread the word about Autonauts was an
  integral part of the campaign, with 36,666,410 views from over 100 content
  creators during the critical month 1 launch period on YouTube – many of whom
  covered the game in multiple videos. This success was also replicated on
  Twitch as well, with over 203,605 of Autonauts watched with 782 broadcasters
  dedicating time to streaming the game throughout month 1. 


  All of our interactions with content creators was 100% organic, with no
  streams or videos being paid for.
