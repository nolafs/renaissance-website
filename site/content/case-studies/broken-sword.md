For Revolution, Gamescom 2023 served as the global first reveal for the developer’s 4k ‘remake’ or Reforged of the 1990s narrative adventure classic **Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars** & a brand-new chapter in the series, **Broken Sword Parzival’s Stone.**

The main challenge was managing what was a complex message, lifting the lid on both games at the same time, with their respective positioning, without the projects cannibalising each other, as well as ensuring what is now a near 30-year-old franchise can speak to new audiences.

Utilising an announcement at Xbox’s Gamescom showcase as the starting pistol, almost **270 articles were generated with a monthly audience of just under 750 million people worldwide.**

On top of that a curated pre-Gamescom rounds of interview and over 20 Tier 1 media interviews in Cologne completed a really successful 360-degree announcement.

**“This renaissance will reinvigorate the series & appeal to old fans and new players alike,”** brilliantly summed up by TheGamer’s Meg Pelliccio.

 **“It’s the perfect opportunity for me to replay & reacquaint myself with an old favourite, but for the new generation, like my young son, it’s a whole new experience."**
